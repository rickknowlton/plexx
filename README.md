## <a name="about"></a> About
The year is 1943, Colonel Sergei Volkov, part of the secret, yet inconspicous Agency for Internal Affairs (AVD) has been briefed and sent on a mission to the Arctic Circle as reconnaisance to surveil an illusive division of Nazi scientists known only as A.G.A.R.T.H.A.

After several days, Colonel Volkov had found no trace of a Nazi presence, but during the expedition a heavy snow squall separated Volkov and his team. Battling thru the snow, Volkov found his way to shelter in an ice cave. Soon, Volkov realized it was more than just a cave. It was then that everything changed...
