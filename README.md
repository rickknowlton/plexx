# A classic platform-style game, built with Phaser2 within React.

Our eponymous hero, Surnin 'Plexx' Georgiy, fancied himself a bit of an adventurous archeologist (think Indiana Jones) and grew enamored of the Three-torus model of the universe proposed in the mid 80's. So enamored, that he set out to prove that the Earth was actually torodal rather than spherical.

His adventures led him north of the artic cirlce where he found the proof he needed... except he was careless and fell into the donut.

You now play as Plexx as he discovers aspects of Earth that have been yet unseen.
